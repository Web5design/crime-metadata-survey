crime-metadata-survey
=====================

examples of crime data published by various police departments

this is a project started by the OpenOakland civic hacking meetup, we are interested in knowing how Oakland's crime data compares to the rest of the US (or world)

If there is crime data available in your community and you don't see it here, either open an issue linking to it or send a PR with examples of the crime data
